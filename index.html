</p>I was born in 2007 and have grown up in Brooklyn, New York my entire life.
<br>I used to walk to my middle school, but during high school, I had to travel to Manhattan on the train everyday.
<br>I have played football and swimming since I was in 2nd grade up until my senior year of high school. I enjoy watching football every Saturday and Sunday, supporting Syracuse and the Dallas Cowboys.
<br>I love working out at Barnes and try to maintain a consistent routine of 5 days a week. </P>
